## Powering Texas’ Digital Economy – Data Centers and the Future of the Grid 

**1. Executive Summary (1 Page)**
- Brief overview of data center growth in Texas and its economic importance. 
- Key energy challenges posed by increased data center demand.  
- Policy recommendations to ensure grid reliability while fostering economic growth. 

**2. Introduction: The Rise of Data Centers in Texas** 
- Texas as a prime destination for data centers (business-friendly policies, land availability, tax incentives, etc.). 
- Role of data centers in economic development, job creation, and digital infrastructure. 
- Forecasted growth trends for data centers in Texas. 

**3. The Trilemma** 
- Electricity intensity of data centers (baseline and projected demand). 
- Impact on ERCOT grid, peak load concerns, and reliability issues. 
- Potential strain on transmission and distribution infrastructure. 
- Water intensity of data centers (cooling) 
- Resilience concerns in extreme weather events (e.g., Winter Storm Uri). 

**4. Opportunities for Grid Reliability and Sustainability**
