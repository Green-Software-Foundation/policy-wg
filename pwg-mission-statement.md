# Policy Working Group Mission Statement
The Policy Working Group (PWG) is a nonpartisan convening body that translates technical expertise in sustainable software into actionable policy insights. As part of a 501(c)(6) organization, we actively identify and advocate for policies that encourage the reduction of carbon emissions from software. 

Our Approach: We build credible engagement through technical expertise, identify strategic opportunities to influence sustainable software policy, maintain consistency between our stated goals and actions, operate with full transparency about our positions and outcomes, and hold ourselves accountable for the impact of our policy work through regular review and reporting.

## What do we do? 
- Convert complex software sustainability research into clear policy frameworks and principles
- Facilitate dialogue between technologists, policymakers, and industry experts
- Establish measurable efficiency standards based on evidence and consensus
- Provide policymakers with technical insights on sustainable software practices
- Participate in existing policy processes where our expertise adds value

## What do we NOT do? 
- Endorse specific legislation or candidates
- Engage in lobbying as a primary activity
- Advocate for partisan political positions

We focus on **policy engagemen**t rather than lobbying, emphasizing:
- Evidence-based insights 
- Technical expertise as our primary contribution
- Neutral frameworks that inform rather than direct policy decisions
- Multi-stakeholder dialogue rather than single-interest promotion

## Influences and references
We define policy engagement following the definition in the [**UN Global Compact Guide for Responsible Corporate Engagement in Climate Policy (2013)**](https://unglobalcompact.org/library/501), and align our activities with the principles of legitimacy, opportunity, consistency, transparency, and accountability as outlined in that document. This document also draws inspiration from the [**We Mean Business Coalition’s Framework for Responsible Policy Engagement**](https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/rpe/), as well as the methodology used for [**InfluenceMap’s platform for tracking corporate climate policy engagement**](https://lobbymap.org/briefing/LobbyMap-Methodology-24422#briefing_section-30671).
