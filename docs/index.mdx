## Summary

- Ensure the Foundation’s trademarks are being used correctly and in a context that doesn't diminish the Foundation's value.
- Define guidance regarding when, how and in what context the Foundation’s trademarks can be used.

### How we work

- We work in the open, and use discussions on GitHub, along with a mailing list and slack channel, for async discussion. We pair this with weekly zoom meetings every Tuesday. We hold these at meetings at alternating times to account for members in Eastern and Western time zones, and you can [see the minutes of every meeting on our repo on GitHub](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/policy_wg/tree/main/Agenda_Minutes).
- You don’t need to be a trademark lawyer to be part of the group, - but it helps to be curious about how the law is used to set norms for groups.
