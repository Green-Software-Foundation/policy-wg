## Antitrust Policy
Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy.

## Handover of Trademark WG activities

Chris outlined that before we move forward with the Policy WG, there is a requirement to specify what is happening with some outstanding topics;

- GSF Trademark registration & Policy
> Chris Adams 

Anything involving anything related to creating a trademark should sit within this working group.

> No further comments or objections

- GSF Training certification 

Asim - One of the things that we're doing, in the principles and patterns WG is creating actual training, then we're going to determine how that's going to be examined and certified. There was another idea proposed, which is, what if we just did the examination and no content? It would then be up to other organisations to create the content. Microsoft could have its own training programme, but we're the ones who administer the examination, similar to how CNCF does it. Asim proposed that the actual training material and the examination certification, would sit in the Community Working Group.

## [Policy Scope](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dE-cz7vlZwrOG9Fnw5-43VSLhoHu7qZaoHtsurabSkI/edit)
  
  WG reviewed and agreed on-line editorial updates to the Scope of the WG
  
 ``` 
- Advise GSF on advocacy and signing up as signatories to initiatives, e.g. carbon call.
- Engaging with external bodies and campaigns, commenting on existing or proposed policy related to green software as well as creating our own policy proposals.
- Managing projects related to the green certification of products and services.
  - Leverage “practitioner” level of implementation of certification
  - GSF value could be a convener across major enterprises (BCG; Accenture) to lead the discussion about what “green certification” looks like, from policy, legal, open-knowledge, baselining, etc.
    - Research needed: Who else is working on green certification and what progress has been made?
```

Elise - We met maybe a few weeks ago now to try to kind of put together some thoughts on how we understand the scope of this of this working group, and some of the projects that might be priority.
In terms of scope, engaging with external bodies and campaigns, commenting on producer demand scrolling there, you can give commentary on existing or proposed policy related to green software as well as creating our own policy proposals, and then managing projects related to the green certification of products and services and awesome. Do we want this committee to review it and provide a recommendation to the steering committee? Asim - This would be an advisory then the steering committee would make the final call/approval.
  
Lisa - The sustainable IP group may be a good place we can start to align because one of their primary objectives is to offer green certification, and it makes little sense for the GSF to compete with them. But we want to be sure if we're going to collaborate we want to understand what it is exactly that they represent and who they are. Asim/Elise - We have reached out to them and have received no response. Lisa indicated, she'll reach out to sustainability IP Group.
